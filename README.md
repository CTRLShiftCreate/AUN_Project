# AUN_Project
This is the repository containing the files for building the AUN Mobile Portal.

We are going to merge the OpenERP, Email, Canvas, Ebooks store and Library into one app that is easily accessible to every student. Later on, an effort might be made to create a version for the staff.

Goals:
1. Accessiblity
2. Ease of Use
3. Make everyone a little bit lazier

# Progress
The login page is mostly done and over with, interactions are working pretty well. ID and Password verification will be worked after we are given access to the database.

# Next Step
The home page and other related routes have to be worked on, including interactions for the skeleton to be considered complete.
