# AUN_Project
This is the repository containing the files for building the AUN Mobile Portal.

We are going to merge the OpenERP, Email, Canvas, Ebooks store and Library into one app that is easily accessible to every student. Later on, an effort might be made to create a version for the staff.

Goals:
1. Accessiblity
2. Ease of Use
3. Make everyone a little bit lazier
